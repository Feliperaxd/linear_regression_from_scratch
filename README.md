Basically, the code just uses math to calculate the linear regression. No Numpy!
Just Matplotlib to show chart and Random to create random data

Note:
Don't use this code in your code, this code is just to teach linear regression code!
If you wanna calculate linear regression, you should use the Numpy, this is the best framework for that
